# Generate keys
ssh-keygen

# keys will be stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Public key goes into server "authorized_keys" file
# That's how server know if machine is authorized

# copy public to server
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@ip "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
# Alternatively you can use ssh-copy-id, but need to install that tool first

# ssh-add is a command for adding SSH private keys into the SSH authentication agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
